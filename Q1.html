        <p>The front end is the Graphical User Interface (GUI). Users who interact, i.e. overall design, texts, videos, images, etc., <br>
         can get access to various services such as navigating to different menus,<br>
          searching for the products etc. On the other side, Users can not see the Back end, <br>
         which handles how the website should function</p>
        
         <p>The back end includes an application, server, and database. Computer users often do not see the elements of back-end development,<br>
             which remain below the hood of a website. <br>
             Back-end developers need advanced experience in server-side programming languages like Java, Python, and Ruby to build applications.</p>
